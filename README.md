This repo is a fork of the [mirror](https://github.com/mietek/sf) by [MiÃ«tek Bak](https://mietek.io/) of the [Software Foundations](http://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) series of books.

It seems that the main interest of the mirror is to produce PDF files, while the main interest of this branch on the fork is just tracking changes between releases. Therefore, only sources are contained and change history is compressed.
